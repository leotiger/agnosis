Art blooming out of oblivion. Email your art, AI polishes it, the world sees it.

== Description ==

**Agnosis** is a free, federated publishing network for independent artists.

Artists who are great at creating — but not at promoting — can simply **send an email** with their artwork and a short description. Agnosis takes it from there:

1. **Receives** the email (via IMAP or webhook)
2. **Enhances** the images with AI (OpenAI / Stability AI)
3. **Writes** a title, description and tags with AI (Claude / GPT-4o)
4. **Publishes** a gallery post automatically
5. **Broadcasts** to the Fediverse (Mastodon, Pixelfed) via ActivityPub

**Community-first admission.** New artists are vouched in by existing artists — no gatekeepers, no committees. The community grows itself.

**Zero cost to artists.** Agnosis is free. Revenue comes only from optional visitor donations and art sales (a small transaction fee). Artists never pay to participate.

**Rhizome network.** Any site can run an Agnosis node. Nodes federate with each other and with the broader Fediverse. No central server. No single point of failure.

4. Artists apply at `/wp-json/agnosis/v1/admission/apply` and are vouched in by peers

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it really free for artists? =
Yes. Always. Revenue comes from a small fee on donations and art sales — only when money changes hands.

= Do I need to run my own server? =
No. Node hosts in the network can offer space to artists. But if you want your own node, install this plugin on any WordPress site.

= Which AI providers do I need? =
At minimum one API key. OpenAI alone covers both description and enhancement. Claude gives richer artistic descriptions if you have both.

= Does this work with Mastodon? =
Yes. Once ActivityPub is enabled, your node is a Fediverse actor. Mastodon users can follow `@agnosis@yoursite.com` and see new artworks in their feed.
