Art blooming out of oblivion. Email your art, AI polishes it, the world sees it.

== Description ==

**Agnosis** is a free, federated publishing network for independent artists.

Artists who are great at creating — but not at promoting — can simply **send an email** with their artwork, a biography, or an event, and a short description. Agnosis takes it from there:

1. **Receives** the email (via IMAP or webhook) — images, sound, and video are all supported
2. **Enhances** the images with AI (OpenAI)
3. **Writes** a title, description and tags with AI (Claude / GPT-4o)
4. **Publishes** a gallery post automatically
5. **Broadcasts** to the Fediverse (Mastodon, Pixelfed) via ActivityPub

Once published, an artist can also correct their own title, text, or photos directly on the site — no need to compose another email. Agnosis requires the companion Lingua Forge plugin (installed and active before Agnosis can be activated) for automatic multi-language translation of every post and taxonomy term. Followers can get a digest newsletter of what's new instead of checking back manually, and an in-site Artist Guide walks new members through the whole email-driven workflow in plain language.

**Community-first admission.** New artists are vouched in by existing artists — no gatekeepers, no committees. The community grows itself.

**Zero cost to artists — for now.** Agnosis doesn't charge artists to participate. A future revenue layer of optional visitor donations and art sales (with a configurable transaction fee) is planned and partly scaffolded in Settings → Commerce, but that donation/store mechanism itself hasn't been built yet — today, running a node has no revenue feature to enable.

**Rhizome network.** Any site can run an Agnosis node. Nodes federate with each other and with the broader Fediverse. No central server. No single point of failure. Nodes can also run in a subdomain mode, giving each artist their own scoped `artistname.yoursite.com` space.

= Core Features =

* Email-to-post: IMAP + webhook support, for artwork, biographies, and events
* Image, sound, and video submissions (HEIC/PDF normalization, video poster-frame extraction)
* AI image enhancement (OpenAI gpt-image-1)
* AI artwork description (Claude, GPT-4o Vision)
* Front-end correction: artists can edit their own published title, text, or photos afterward, no re-submission needed
* Visitor contact form: message an artist directly from their page, spam-limited per IP/sender and per artist
* Biography social links: a portfolio link plus three optional social links, shown as an icon row on the artist's biography page; an optional site-wide preset biography title is also available
* Community vouching / admission system
* ActivityPub federation (Mastodon-compatible)
* Node identity & peer discovery
* Per-artist subdomain mode
* Digest newsletter for followers; in-site Artist Guide page
* Settings → Commerce holds a configurable transaction-fee percentage for a planned donation/store revenue layer — not yet a working checkout
* `agnosis_artwork`/`agnosis_biography`/`agnosis_event` custom post types with Gutenberg gallery blocks
* Settings: General | Branding | Email | AI Providers | Behavior | Network | Community | Commerce | Newsletter | Logs

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate **Lingua Forge** first — Agnosis declares it as a required plugin (WordPress 6.5+ Plugin Dependencies) and will refuse to activate with only a generic error if it isn't already installed and active.
2. Upload the `agnosis` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Activate via **Plugins → Installed Plugins**
4. Go to **Agnosis** in the admin sidebar and configure your email inbox and AI API keys
5. Artists apply at the **`/join/`** page and are vouched in by peers

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it really free for artists? =
Yes. Agnosis never charges artists to participate. A donation/art-sale revenue model with a configurable transaction fee is planned (Settings → Commerce holds the fee setting), but that mechanism hasn't been built yet, so no money currently changes hands through the plugin either way.

= Do I need to run my own server? =
No. Node hosts in the network can offer space to artists. But if you want your own node, install this plugin on any WordPress site.

= Which AI providers do I need? =
At minimum one API key. OpenAI alone covers both description and enhancement. Claude gives richer artistic descriptions if you have both.

= Does this work with Mastodon? =
Yes. Once ActivityPub is enabled, your node is a Fediverse actor. Mastodon users can follow `@agnosis@yoursite.com` and see new artworks in their feed.

== Changelog ==

= 0.9.38 =
* Added: The Tags and Mediums admin screens (Posts → Artwork → Mediums, etc.) now show only your own primary-language terms by default, with a new dropdown to switch to any other configured language — no more hundreds of AI-translated duplicates mixed into one list. Mediums also got a "Sync translations" action to create a term's translation in every configured language on demand, and editing an artwork's medium after publishing now correctly updates its already-translated sibling posts too, instead of leaving them stuck on the old term.
* Added: A "Sync all translations" button next to the Tags/Mediums language dropdown syncs every primary-language term to every configured language in one click, instead of the "Sync translations" row action one term at a time. It's safe to click again if a large vocabulary times out partway through — it resumes rather than redoing work.
* Added: A new "Medium translations" box on each artwork's edit screen, plus a matching bulk action on the artwork list screen, lets you push an artwork's medium onto its already-translated sibling posts on demand — useful for pairs that drifted out of sync before the automatic version above existed.
* Fixed: Term translations are now linked to their source term by a stable ID instead of by matching names, so re-syncing after a re-translation no longer creates near-duplicate terms.
* Fixed: Tags and mediums created automatically while AI-tagging a submission in a non-primary language are now correctly recorded as translations, instead of silently joining your primary-language vocabulary.

= 0.9.37 =
* Added: New "Artwork Copyright" block automatically shows a "© {year} {artist name}" credit line on every single artwork page — the year comes from the artwork's own publish date, the name from the artist. Font size, color, and font family are all configurable from the block's own Inspector panel.
* Fixed: The gallery overview's medium-filter pills mixed every language's translated medium term into one row, offered pills for mediums that had no artwork behind them in the current gallery, and reloaded the whole page on every click. The filter now only shows pills that actually apply to what you're browsing, and clicking a pill or a page number updates the gallery instantly instead of reloading the page.
