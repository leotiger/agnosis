/**
 * Agnosis — self-hosted update manifest endpoint.
 *
 * Deploy to: wp-content/mu-plugins/agnosis-update-manifest.php on agnosis.art.
 *
 * Registers GET /wp-json/agnosis/v1/update and returns the plugin update
 * manifest as JSON with no-cache headers so every request fetches live data
 * regardless of server-side or CDN caching.
 *
 * On every release: update $version, $download_url, and prepend the new
 * entry to $sections['changelog']. $sha256/$sha256_note/$last_updated are a
 * machine-managed trio — see their own comment below; a hand version-bump
 * only needs to reset all three to their "not built yet" defaults, never
 * write real values into any of them by hand.
 *
 * MANIFEST_URL in agnosis/includes/Core/Updater.php must point to:
 * https://agnosis.art/wp-json/agnosis/v1/update
 *
 * Modeled directly on the companion Lingua Forge plugin's own
 * docs/lf-update-manifest.php (deployed the same way to lingua-forge.com),
 * so both self-hosted plugins are administered identically.
 *
 * @package Agnosis

	// SHA-256 of the release ZIP, a one-line human-readable status note, and
	// the date this version's zip was actually built — all three fields are
	// exclusively maintained by dev/bin/build-zip.sh, never by hand. The
	// script clears $sha256/$sha256_note to their "not built" defaults at the
	// START of every run (so a failed or superseded build never leaves a
	// stale digest behind — empty $sha256 = verification skipped, a safe
	// documented default; a stale one would silently BREAK update
	// verification instead, since WordPress would hash the newly-downloaded
	// zip and compare it against a digest belonging to a DIFFERENT zip, which
	// can never match), then writes all three real values once the build
	// succeeds. $last_updated is intentionally NOT cleared at the start the
	// way $sha256 is — there's no "unsafe stale value" risk for a plain
	// display date the way there is for a digest silently mismatching, so a
	// failed build simply leaves the previous successful build's date in
	// place rather than blanking it.
	//
	// $sha256_note exists specifically so this file can never again say
	// "pending"/"cleared" in hand-written prose while $sha256 itself already
	// disagrees — exactly the self-contradiction fourteenth-audit finding 5b
	// caught (a filled digest sitting next to a comment insisting no build had
	// happened yet, because that comment was hand-written at version-bump time
	// and never re-synced once a real build actually ran days later). Now
	// there is only one thing to say, and only the script says it.
	//
	// $last_updated used to be a separate hand-set-at-ship-time field (per its
	// own now-removed TODO comment) — questioned directly: since build-zip.sh
	// already knows today's date (it's already in $sha256_note's own text),
	// there was no real reason to keep this one manual when the documented
	// release process (CONTRIBUTING.md) already builds the zip immediately
	// before shipping it. The date recorded is "when this zip was last built
	// locally," used as a stand-in for "when this version shipped" — accurate
	// for the intended same-session build-then-ship workflow; if a real gap
	// ever opens up between building and actually uploading/deploying, just
	// re-run build-zip.sh right before uploading to refresh the date, the
	// same way you'd re-run it to refresh $sha256 for a changed zip.
	//
	// Hand version-bumps still must reset all three fields to the values
	// below — build-zip.sh only runs at build time, not at version-bump time,
	// so it can't do that part for you. Never write a real digest, a
	// "verified" note, or a real date into any of them by hand.
	$sha256       = 'c807a530f844d7590aca0f1b01ca7bc6771d7417d9d94bf0f0d8d27b10a08f30'; // Not yet built — dev/bin/build-zip.sh computes this at release time.

Reworded to the real promise: your words and photo are never touched or rewritten by AI, which is only ever used to classify the medium and a few tags so your post stays findable.</li>' .

			'<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> A submission sent to the Pure address published with no tags at all, since the classification step computed a medium but silently dropped the tags from the very same AI response. Both are now kept, with no extra AI call needed.</li>' .
			'<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> A gender-neutral phrasing rule for AI translation (added 0.9.39, to stop things like &#8220;artist&#8221; defaulting to a gendered word in German/French/Spanish) was applied to Agnosis&#8217;s own translations but never passed through to Lingua Forge&#8217;s own translation pass &#8212; so an LF-retranslated biography or artwork could regress to a gendered default. Both AI translation instructions now travel together.</li>' .
